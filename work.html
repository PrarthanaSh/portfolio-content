		<h2>Gamified e-learning</h2>
		<p>
			A prominent FinTech organization from Abu Dhabi approached the firm I am working with, to generate e-learning courses that will act as basic introduction to FinTech and associated concepts. The requirement was primarily to engage the audience with gamification.
		</p>
<h3>Preliminary research </h3>
	<ol>
		<li>The scope and nature of content to be presented was identified through multiple discussions</li>
		<li>Detailed audience analysis was carried out by understanding the value proposition.</li>
	</ol>
<h3>Preliminary research </h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Current (2018-) FinTech scenario in the middle east was studied to present case studies and relevant local examples in the course.</li>
		<li>Present learning management system (where the course would be deployed) was identified and studied</li>
	</ol>
