			<p class="projectDescription"> In a post-oandemic era, activities that are mindful, grounding and tethering people to the community have gained more importance. For me, gardening is one of them. However community gardens in India are rare to find. Thsi project explores the solution space of intriducing a digital platform that encourages and supports both home gardening and community gardening. </p>

			<p class="projectDescription">
				Muncipal Solid Waste is a huge threat to our environment. It is a burgeoning and alarming concern that often gets overlooked in the throes of progress. As a group of four, we explore the digital solution space to engage users in a gamified app that encourages them to manage their day-to-day waste better. Based on the fundamentals of reusing, donation and responsible consumerism, the app allows the user to visually see the impact they are making.

				<h2>Plastic Collection Kiosk</h2>
			</div>
			<img src="images/work_project3_Planet.png" alt="Picture of earth overlayed by text - I save the planet">
			<p class="projectDescription">
				Recycling plastics as far as possible is the need of the hour. Introducing this concept into the younger generations, especially school children that are in their growing phases of developing a morale, is a critically important part of public awareness. In addition to academia, this kiosk, projected to be installed in schools, will create an activism in kids to collect plastic waste through the means of accountability and reward incentives like badges.
