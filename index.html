		<h1>Designing for impact</h1>
		<p>
			Like most design students, there was a time when I wanted to create impact. Today, I aim to reduce impact through my design- the impact on our environment.

		<p>
			This portfolio speaks about who I am as a person but also about the work I do, the values I represent and the myriad number of things that interest me.
			It is a hunble attempt in portraying my efforts towards my professional growth and my transition from a seed into a little sapling.
